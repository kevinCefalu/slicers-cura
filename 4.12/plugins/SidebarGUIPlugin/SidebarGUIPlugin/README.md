# Cura Sidebar GUI Plugin

This plugin replaces collapsible settings panel in Cura 4.x with a sidebar like the previous versions. This results in a more settings-centric UX, for those who prefer it. It also adds a legend to the Prepare stage and makes X-Ray view part of this legend.

The Cura Sidebar GUI Plugin is a spiritual successor to the [Compact Prepare Stage](https://github.com/fieldofview/PrepareStageCompactor) plugin, which provided a more compact sidebar for smaller screens.
